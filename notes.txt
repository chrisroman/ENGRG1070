All 5 C60s always start at optimum distance. However, as time goes on, the random
motion of the molecules causes the distance between at least one pair of C60 molecules
to become massive, making it hard for electrons to transfer between all 5 molecules.
The most probable reason for this would be that the C60s are not as tightly packed
as they could be, due to the poor structure of the Pc-Ph COF system

IMPORTANT:
With lower temperatures, the diffusion coefficient would be lower, and thus the electrons
could move through the C60s optimally; that is, assuming that the C60s were in the optimal
positions in the first place. 
The issue with the lower temperatures is that it will be very difficult for the C60s to
move into the optimal positions. For them to do so, the temperature would have to be
high. The problem with this approach though is that the diffusion coefficient would be
higher, causing for more random motion from the C60s. This will cause large gaps in the
system between C60s, decreasing the effective electronic mobility, as shown in our data.

Conclusion:
We believe that there is an optimum range of temperatures

Represent the data in boxplots. Can possibly do 2 of them. One for time t = ~100ps
while the last one is for time t = 1000ps or 1ns
