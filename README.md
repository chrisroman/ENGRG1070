Final Project For Spatial Visualization (Purely for Educational Purposes)

This project was intended to analyze data as though it were for professional research. The data was given to us by Yaset Acevado
and presented to our client Dr. Clancy. We were to determine the efficiency of Pc-Ph as an Organic Solar Cell by finding
the "electron mobility" and the "diffusion coefficient". Our group assigned different tasks to each other as follows:

Christopher Roman(me) - Run through the data given in the simulation of the Pc-Ph solar cell with one C60, as well as with five C60s
and output the data for electron mobility and diffusion coefficient to a text file.

David Gonzalez - Take the observed data of electron mobility and diffusion coefficient and create graphs using Matlab.

Olivia Scott - View the actual simulation using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) and make sense of the conclusions from the data analysis.

The code shown in the repository shows how I analyzed and outputted this data.

The diffusion coefficient data is found in "points.zip" and the electron mobility data is found in "electron_mobility.zip"

The final powerpoint presentation is also provided.
